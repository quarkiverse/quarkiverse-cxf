= Creating a SOAP Client

In order to support a SOAP client, register the endpoint URL and the service endpoint interface (same as the server) with the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/fruit".client-endpoint-url=http://localhost:8080/
quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/fruit".service-interface=org.acme.cxf.FruitWebService
----

Then inject the client as shown below to use it. Note that the Quarkus container must instantiate the client, ie. the client must be injected in a class which is managed and instantiated by the container. If you need a main, you can use the QuarkusMain annotation (cf https://quarkus.io/guides/lifecycle).

[source,java]
----
public class MySoapClient {

    @Inject
    FruitWebService clientService;

    public int getCount() {
        return clientService.count();
    }
}
----

[[basic-auth]]
== Basic Auth

Basic auth for clients is supported by default. Just add the following properties to your `application.properties` file.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/greeting".username=user
quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/greeting".password=password
----
