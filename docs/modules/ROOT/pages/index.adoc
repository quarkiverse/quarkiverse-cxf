= CXF Extension for Quarkus

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a normalized exchange protocol based on XML, predating the era of REST services.

This extension enables you to develop web services that consume and produce SOAP payloads using the http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] libraries.

- CXF implements the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) which makes building web services easy.

- CXF supports a variety of web service specifications including http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-addressing.html[WS-Addressing], http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-policy.html[WS-Policy], http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-reliablemessaging.html[WS-Reliable Messaging] and http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-security.html[WS-Security].

This extension provides access to all these specifications for your Quarkus applications (testing and documentation in progress).

[[contract-code-first]]
== Contract vs Code First
CXF provides a https://cxf.apache.org/docs/wsdl-to-java.html[wsdl2java] utility as well as a Maven plugin called https://cxf.apache.org/docs/maven-cxf-codegen-plugin-wsdl-to-java.html[cxf-codegen-plugin] to generate fully annotated Java code from a WSDL document.

Contract and code first development are both fully supported in this extension, for both client and server implementations.
