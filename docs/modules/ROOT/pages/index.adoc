= CXF Extension for Quarkus

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a normalized exchange protocol based on XML, predating the era of REST services.

This extension enables you to develop web services that consume and produce SOAP payloads using the http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] libraries.

- CXF implements the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) which makes building web services easy.

- CXF supports a variety of web service specifications including http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-addressing.html[WS-Addressing], http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-policy.html[WS-Policy], http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-reliablemessaging.html[WS-Reliable Messaging] and http://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-security.html[WS-Security].

This extension provides access to all these specifications for your Quarkus applications (testing and documentation in progress).

[[native-mode-support]]
== Native Mode Support

Native mode is currently supported for both Java 8 and Java 11.

[[contract-code-first]]
== Contract vs Code First
Contract and code first development are both fully supported in this extension, for both client and server implementations.

You can refer to the following links for more details on the two different styles of developing or consuming web services.

* https://cxf.apache.org/docs/developing-a-service.html#DevelopingaService-JavaFirstDevelopment[Code First Development]

CXF provides a https://cxf.apache.org/docs/wsdl-to-java.html[wsdl2java] utility as well as a Maven plugin called https://cxf.apache.org/docs/maven-cxf-codegen-plugin-wsdl-to-java.html[cxf-codegen-plugin] to generate fully annotated Java code from a WSDL document.  The autogenerated Java classes are fully compliant with this extension.

[[sample-code-integration-tests]]
== Sample Code
The `integration-tests` module in the codebase provides various examples that demonstrate how to use this extension effectively.
